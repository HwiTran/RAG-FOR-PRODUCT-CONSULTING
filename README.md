# Some stuffs
I noticed that some of my friends were having problems finding scientific papers for their purposes. In my opinions, there are 2 main reasons:
- Information overload: Papers can be too lengthy and the abstract is hard to understand, making it difficult to find what they need quickly.
- Skimming and Scanning struggles: They lack the skills to effectively skim and scan for keywords, leading to wasted time reading irrelevant sections.
So that is the motivation for me to make scientific research more accessible and efficient

I will update something more...
